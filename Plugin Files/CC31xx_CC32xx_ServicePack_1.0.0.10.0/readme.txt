3. Header files for Host Programming

1. UNIFLASH Image 
================================================================================
Files:
- servicepack_1.0.0.10.0.bin

This ServicePack image can be used with pre-production silicon as well as with
production silicon.
The list of silicon that are compatible with this ServicePack are:
 - CC3100R1
 - XCC3100HZ
 - XCC3100JR
 - CC3200R1
 - XCC3200HZ
 - XCC3200JR
